        There are four data locations:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>1.</td>
          <td>Local Workspace</td>
          <td>Local folder tree containig the physical files under construction.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2.</td>
          <td>Local repository</td>
          <td>Local branches and their modifications.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3.</td>
          <td>Local copy of remote repositories</td>
          <td>All data of all configured remotes (<i>remote tracking branches</i>), each of them according to their last fetch date.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4.</td>
          <td>The real remote repositories, possibly more than one.</td>
          <td>All data of all configured remotes, each of them according to their last fetch date.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        The one and only <b>HEAD</b> may be <i>detached</i>. 
        Then it points to the last revision checked out. 
        Further commits do not move this HEAD.<br>
        HEAD may be <i>attached</i> to a <i>local</i> branch. 
        Then it automatically follows all following commits of that branch.<br>
        Attaching HEAD to a remote tracking branch or a revision is not possible.<br>
        Committing changes in detached state is possible, 
        but the changes tend to get lost because of the missing named reference.
