    <div>
      <h1>git revert</h1>
      
      <h2>git revert 1542affe</h2>
      <p>
        Create a new commit that reverts all changes of the commit <i>1542affe</i>.
        Build the commit message from the reverted commit, prepending it by the word "Revert".
      </p>
      
      <h2>git revert b1..b2</h2>
      <p>
        Revert all the changes contained in branch b2 but not in branch b1.
        Create a new commit for every reverted commit. 
        Do this reverting in reverse order.
      </p>
      
      <h2>git revert ^b1 b2</h2>
      <p>
        Revert the commit b1, then the commit b2. 
        This means that <i>^b1 b2</i> is NOT the same as <i>b1..b2</i> as it is in other cases!
      </p>
      
    </div>
