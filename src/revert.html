      <h1>git revert</h1>
      
      <h2>git revert 1542affe</h2>
      <p>
        Create a new commit that reverts all changes of the commit <i>1542affe</i>.
        Build the commit message from the reverted commit, prepending it by the word "Revert".
        <i>1542affe</i> must not be a merge commit.
      </p>
      
      <h2>git revert -m 1 1542affe</h2>
      <p>
        Same as above, but <i>1542affe</i> is a merge commit and <i>-m 1</i> selects 
        parent 1 (<i>-m 2</i> would select parent 2) as target.
        To find out which is parent 1 and which is parent 2, 
        you can use the command <i>git log -1 1542affe</i>. 
        The output mentions both parents in line 2 after the key word "Merge".
        Parent 1 is mentioned first, parent 2 is mentioned second.
      </p>
      
      <h2>git revert b1..b2</h2>
      <p>
        Revert all the changes contained in branch b2 but not in branch b1.
        Create a new commit for every reverted commit. 
        Do this reverting in reverse order.
        No merge commits are allowed on the path to be reverted.
        If you must revert a merge commit you have to specify 
        the parent number by option <i>-m 1</i> or <i>-m 2</i>.
      </p>
      
      <h2>git revert ^b1 b2</h2>
      <p>
        Revert the commit b1, then the commit b2. 
        This means that <i>^b1 b2</i> is NOT the same as <i>b1..b2</i> as it is in other cases!
      </p>
      
    </div>
